## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- sass CSS compiler
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Be more organised from the start by studying the layout to get the most out of it and do not repeat myself and changing layout system too often.
- Order element with CSS Grid
- Srcset attribute for responsive website
- organise more my Sass workflow

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on how to use Media query with Sass. My approach hasn't been the most DRY as I wish it could be. This could be more refine.
The image sizing was quite challenging. I haven't master yet the srcset attribute for a set of images.

I woudl like to explore more how to create a more reponsive CSS Grid Hero image - All the page could have been done with CSS Grid if i wqas more organise at the beginning.

I need to explore more the different mobile menu feature with JS.
