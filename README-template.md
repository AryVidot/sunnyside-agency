## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- sass CSS compiler
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-

### What I learned

- Be more organised from the start by studying the layout to get the most out of it and do not repeat myself and changing layout system too often.
- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on how to use Media query with Sass. My approach hasn't been the most DRY as I wish it could be. This could be more refine.
The image sizing was quite challenging. I haven't master yet the srcset attribute for a set of images.

I woudl like to explore more how to create a more reponsive CSS Grid Hero image - All the page could have been done with CSS Grid if i wqas more organise at the beginning.

- [CSS Gris Hero Image](https://dev.to/billraymond/creating-a-pure-responsive-css-grid-hero-image-or-banner-image-2pej)

I need to explore more the different mobile menu feature with JS.

### Useful resources

- [Reorder Element with CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_ESZ1Jt_NQ) - easy to understand video for changing the element order in CSS Grid - There is not enough views for how good it it is.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Srcset](https://yatendrapratapsingh.blogspot.com/2020/06/mobile-first-approach-picture-srcset.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use "srcset" in my project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Convert HEX to HSL](https://colordesigner.io/convert/hextohsl) - This is an amazing tool when working with HSL.
- [Git revert command](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-revert/) - I learn a bit more about how to revert, check and reset commit from the command line.
- [Git - Undoing Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIYrfkZjWmA&t=315s) - This video will teach you the basics of undoing things with git.
